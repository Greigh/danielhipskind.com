        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><em>Last updated: December 1, 2025</em></p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Adamas is designed with privacy in mind. Most application data,
          including notes, patterns, settings, and user preferences, remains
          stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage and
          is never transmitted to our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >We do not collect any personal information from anonymous
            users.</strong
          >
          Server-side data collection only occurs when you create and log into
          an Adamas account for advanced features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Account Information:</strong> Username, email, and
            encrypted password for authentication purposes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Twilio SMS Integration:</strong> Account credentials
            (Account SID, Auth Token, phone number) are stored securely on our
            servers for SMS functionality, but only when you explicitly
            configure this feature
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All integration credentials are encrypted and associated only with
          your specific user account. You can view, modify, or delete this
          information at any time through your account settings, or delete your
          account entirely to remove all server-stored data.
        </p>

        <h3>Anonymous Usage</h3>
        <p>
          You can use Adamas without creating an account or logging in. When
          used anonymously:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No personal information is collected or stored</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>No data is transmitted to our servers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>All functionality works entirely offline</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Advanced features like SMS integration are not available</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li><strong>Your privacy is completely protected</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Anonymous usage provides full access to core call center tools
          including number formatting, call logging, notes, timers, and basic
          settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Storage Usage</h3>
        <p>
          The application uses browser local storage (which never leaves your
          browser) to save your:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Number Formatter Data:</strong> Custom formatting patterns
            for account numbers, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (SSNs),
            and other sensitive numerical data
          </li>
          <li>Call notes and conversation records</li>
          <li>Application settings and preferences</li>
          <li>Timer configurations</li>
          <li>Theme selections</li>
          <li>Other user interface customizations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any
          third parties.
          <strong
            >For anonymous users, this is the only data storage used.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Integration credentials (such as Twilio API keys) are only stored
          securely on our servers when you are logged into a Call Center Helper
          account and explicitly configure these advanced features through the
          authenticated settings interface.
        </p>

        <h3>Number Formatter and Sensitive Data</h3>
        <p>
          The Number Formatter feature allows you to create and apply custom
          formatting patterns to various types of sensitive numerical data. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Phone Numbers:</strong> Formatting for domestic and
            international numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account Numbers:</strong> Bank accounts, credit cards,
            customer IDs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Security Numbers (SSNs):</strong> US Social Security
            Numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other Sensitive Data:</strong> Tax IDs, license numbers,
            policy numbers, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> All formatting patterns and the
          data you input for formatting remain stored locally on your device
          only. No sensitive numerical data or formatting patterns are ever
          transmitted to our servers or third parties. The Number Formatter
          operates entirely offline and within your browser's secure
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable data
          protection laws (such as HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA) when handling sensitive
          information through the Number Formatter. We recommend using this
          feature only with data you have proper authorization to process.
        </p>

        <h3>CRM Integration and API Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Call Center Helper supports integration with various CRM systems
          (Cisco Finesse, Five9, Salesforce, Zendesk, HubSpot, and Microsoft
          Dynamics 365). When you configure CRM connections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>API keys and credentials are stored locally in your browser</li>
          <li>Sensitive information is never transmitted to our servers</li>
          <li>You can disconnect and clear stored credentials at any time</li>
          <li>Demo mode is available when CRM systems are unreachable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All CRM API calls are made directly from your browser to the CRM
          provider's servers. We do not proxy, log, or store any CRM data.
        </p>

        <h3>SMS and Twilio Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Call Center Helper supports SMS messaging through Twilio integration
          for authenticated users only.
          <strong>This feature is not available to anonymous users.</strong>
          When you log into your Call Center Helper account and configure SMS
          functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number are stored
            securely on our servers, encrypted and associated only with your
            user account
          </li>
          <li>
            SMS message content is transmitted directly to Twilio's servers for
            delivery and is not stored or logged by us
          </li>
          <li>
            Phone numbers you send SMS messages to are processed temporarily
            during message delivery and are not retained after transmission
          </li>
          <li>
            You have full control to configure, modify, or remove your Twilio
            credentials at any time through the Settings page
          </li>
          <li>
            SMS functionality requires your explicit setup and cannot be used
            without your Twilio account configuration
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All SMS communications are handled securely through Twilio's encrypted
          API. We do not have access to your SMS message content, delivery
          status, or recipient information beyond what is necessary for the
          immediate transmission process.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, analytics services, or any
          form of user tracking. Your browsing activity is not monitored or
          recorded by us.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
          Since all data is stored locally on your device, security depends on
          your device's security measures. We recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using strong device passwords</li>
          <li>Keeping your browser and operating system updated</li>
          <li>Using antivirus software</li>
          <li>Being cautious with shared devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cloudflare Services</h3>
        <p>
          We use Cloudflare to provide content delivery network (CDN) services,
          DDoS protection, and web security for our application. When you access
          Call Center Helper:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cloudflare may collect standard web server logs including IP
            addresses, browser information, and access timestamps
          </li>
          <li>
            This information is used solely for security, performance, and
            analytics purposes to protect and optimize our service
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloudflare's data collection and privacy practices are governed by
            their own
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacy/" target="_blank"
              >Privacy Policy</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            We have configured Cloudflare to minimize data collection and
            respect user privacy
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloudflare data is not combined with any personal information we may
            collect from authenticated users
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Cloudflare helps ensure the security and reliability of our service
          while maintaining your privacy. Their services do not affect the local
          storage of your data or our server-side data collection policies.
